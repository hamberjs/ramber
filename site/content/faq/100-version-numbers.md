question: Ramber is not 1.0 yet. Should I use it? What about HamberKit?
---

We are currently working on Ramber's successor, [HamberKit](https://hamberkit.web.app/). There are still some known issues to resolve and aspects of the design that will change. Whether you want to start on HamberKit will be determined by how willing you are to deal with bumps in the road during a beta period. If you want to evaluate starting on the more stable Ramber project and then migrating to HamberKit, please see the [migration guide](https://hamberkit.web.app/migrating) for details of what's necessary to do that.

Ramber is operationally stable and some of the Hamber maintainers run their businesses on Ramber. "production readiness" is subjective, and if Ramber fulfils your requirements, then it's production ready. As with any software, a major version number is not an indicator of whether something is suitable for your specific use-case.
